# Customer Segmentation for Targeted Marketing (K-Means Clustering)

### Project Overview
This project aimed to optimize a marketing strategy by identifying distinct customer segments (clusters). The results were translated into interactive dashboards to enable data-driven decision-making for marketing teams.

## Business Goal

The main objective was to move beyond generic campaigns by segmenting the customer base into actionable groups. This provided the Marketing team with clear profiles to tailor their communication and budget allocation for a higher return on investment (ROI).
## üî¨ Project Methodology & My Contribution

### My Role: Clustering Specialist & BI Reporter
My responsibilities spanned the analytical and reporting phases of the project:

1.  **Data Analysis & Preparation:** Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to select the optimal features for clustering (e.g., Recency, Frequency, Monetary values).
2.  **Clustering Implementation:** Applied and optimized the **K-Means algorithm** using Scikit-learn. The optimal number of clusters (K) was determined using the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score.
3.  **Segment Interpretation:** Interpreted the statistical characteristics of each resulting cluster to assign meaningful business labels.
4.  **Reporting & Visualization:** Designed and deployed key performance indicators (KPIs) and dashboard visualizations in **Metabase** to track segment performance and campaign effectiveness.

### Key Deliverables
* A clear, labeled customer segmentation model.
* An operational Metabase dashboard for continuous monitoring.
## How to Run the Project Locally

1.  **Clone the Repository:** `git clone https://github.com/mbabedse7ra/Segmentation-Client`
2.  Dataset: The required dataset (`Camp_market_Clean_2025.csv`) is included in the root directory of this repository.
3.  **Run the Analysis:** Execute the steps in `clustering.ipynb` to regenerate the clusters. 
4.  **BI Setup:** Documentation for the Metabase setup is available in the `docs` folder.
